# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a comprehensive application developed using Vite, React, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. This system aims to automate various processes within a library, providing functionalities such as borrowing books, reserving study rooms, viewing and searching the book collection, and accessing detailed information about each book.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: A fast, opinionated web development build tool that serves as the frontend framework for this application.
- **React**: A widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create the backend server.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that enables server-side development.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store and manage the library's data efficiently.

## Development Team

This project was a collaborative effort, with six developers contributing to its successful completion. Each team member played a crucial role in different aspects of the development process, ensuring a well-rounded and feature-rich Library Management System.

## CI/CD Integration

The project is equipped with Docker and utilizes Docker Hub for containerization. GitHub Actions have been implemented for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), ensuring a smooth and automated workflow for development, testing, and deployment processes.
